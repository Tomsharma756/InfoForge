The compound is utilized in various cosmetic products such as serums, creams, lotions, and facial masks. As consumers become increasingly aware of the importance of skin health and product efficacy, 2-Methylresorcinol’s role in protecting the skin from environmental stressors like UV damage and pollutants is becoming more prominent.
